# Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. This program encrypts the input file using this cipher and produces the encrypted text.


## Usage

After downloading the java program, input files, and output files, open the command line window. When you compile the vigenere.java put first the file with the cipher key and second the file with the text to be encrypted. For example:
>**prompt>** *java vigenere k1.txt p1.txt*
