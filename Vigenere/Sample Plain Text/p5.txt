 I am a cashier at a farmers' market in 
Michigan. We sell a huge variety of stuff, 
including fresh shrimp. Today a toddler 
walked by our shrimp cooler and started 
chanting "SHRIMP! HEAVEN! NOW!", emphasis 
on the "NOW!". Eventually leading his mother 
to say "Please Daniel, we can't keep doing 
this." What is Shrimp Heaven? Why does 
Daniel need it now? What are my 
responsibilities in this situation, if any? 
I'm confused and delighted by this 
sloganeering child, but I fear something 
darker may lay under the surface. -- Shrimp
